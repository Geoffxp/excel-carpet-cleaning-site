            <p>At Excel Carpet Cleaning Inc., the safety of our
                customers and employees is always on our minds. As
                everyone is feeling the impact of the coronavirus
                (COVID-19), I want to share with you the steps we're
                taking to help.</p>

            <p>Weâ€™re watching local and national reports on the ever-
                changing impact of COVID-19 and adjusting accordingly.</p>

            <p>We have always had antibacterial soap and hand
                sanitizer in our vans, as well as sanitizing wipes, and
                we will continue to do so, as per our company policy in
                the future. We ask all of our employees who show
                symptoms or come into contact with infected
                individuals to stay home and follow the CDC guidelines
                to prevent the spread of the infection.</p>

            <p>At this time, we are open for business and available to
                continue providing the five star service you expect
                from Excel Carpet Cleaning.</p>

            <p>All of us here feel deeply for those who have been
                impacted by this outbreak. We value your business and
                plan to take all necessary steps to ensure our vans and
                equipment are exceptionally clean and sanitary, and
                safe. Again, the health and safety of our customers,
                employees and our communities are very important to
                us, and we're committed to doing our part.</p>

            <p>Thank you,
                Mike and Mary Jarman
                Field Manager and Office Manager</p>
