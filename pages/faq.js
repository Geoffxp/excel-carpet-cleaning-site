                    <h2>CARPET DRYING TIME?</h2>
                    <p>The carpets are slightly damp after cleaning,
                        and can be walked on with clean non-marking
                        shoes (not with bare feet) in about 30 minutes.
                        Normal soiled carpets usually dry between 3-4
                        hours after cleaning.</p>

                    <h2>HOW MUCH FURNITURE DO YOU MOVE?</h2>
                    <p>We move most light furniture. Couches etc. can be moved by request.</p>

                    <h2>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GET MY CARPETS CLEANED?</h2>
                    <p>The carpet manufacturing industry recommends bi-annually cleaning with truck-mounted
                        steam cleaning equipment to obtain maximum lifespan of your carpet. Professional cleaning
                        does not  damage the carpet. (IICRC)</p>

                    <h2>SHOULD I VACUUM BEFORE CLEANING?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, it always helps to pre-vacuum. 85% of dirt in your carpets is solids.</p>

                    <h2>WHAT IS THE BLACK AROUND THE CARPET EDGES? </h2>
                    <p>This is called filtration edges. It is caused by an air gap between the wall and the sub-floor.
                        Sometimes the filtration edges can be removed depending on how long they have been
                        there.</p>

                    <h2>WHAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SPOT CLEAN?</h2>
                    <p>Spot cleaning can be done by spraying a mild diluted detergent on the spot, and then blot
                        the spot with a clean white damp towel ( DO NOT RUB! YOU WILL DAMAGE THE CARPET
                        FIBERS) Rinse out the towel and repeat as necessary . </p>

                    <h2>WHAT DOES SCOTCHGARD CARPET PROTECTOR DO?</h2>
                    <p>Scotchgard puts a water resistant shield on your carpet, that helps prevent it  from
                        absorbing spills that can turn into permanent stains. Scotchgard can be applied after
                        cleaning for an additional charge.</p>

                <h1>COMMON SPOT CLEANING TIPS</h1>
                <p>Get at stains quickly, 99% of all stains can be removed by one cleaning agent or
                    another if they are cleaned in the first few days. The longer a stain chemically reacts
                    with the carpet the harder it will be to remove it.</p>

                <h2>CANDLE WAX</h2>
                <p>Let the wax harden, then scrap off the excess with a dull knife, fork or spoon.
                    Place part of a paper bag, a sheet of newspaper, paper towels, or a clean cloth over the
                    wax. Using a warm iron, press gently on the paper bag. Be careful not to leave the iron in one
                    place too long or you may burn the carpet fibers. The paper bag will soak up the melted wax.
                    Use a new paper bag as often as necessary until you get all of the wax. This can take some
                    time. Put an ice cube or two on the wax to freeze it, leaving them there for a minute. This
                    should harden the wax enough to break it up and get more of it out.
                    To remove stains left from colored wax, try gently dabbing the stain with a rag dampened
                    with rubbing alcohol. Be sure to use the clear alcohol, not the colored ones. If the alcohol
                    doesn&apos;t do the trick, you can try using dry cleaning solvent.
                    When done removing the candle wax out of the carpet, rinse the area with clean water. Blot
                    up the excess water, and dry the area quickly. A fan can help with this. Quick drying
                    prevents any of the dye stains deeper down from wicking up of the surface..</p>
                <h2>COFFEE SPILL ON CARPET</h2>
                <p>Blot up as much of the spilled coffee as possible. Use plain water or mix one tablespoon of
                    liquid  dishwashing detergent and one tablespoon of white vinegar with two cups of warm
                    water. Using a clean white cloth, sponge the stain with plain water or the detergent/
                    vinegar solution. Apply a little bit at a time, blotting frequently with a dry cloth until the stain
                    disappears. If using a detergent/vinegar solution, sponge with cold water and blot dry to
                    remove the solution.</p>
                <h2>COFFEE AND CREAM</h2>
                <p>If thereâ€™s cream (or milk) in the coffee that caused the stain, be sure to use an enzyme
                    laundry detergent when washing the stained item.</p>
                <h2>COFFEE SPILL ON UPHOLSTERY</h2>
                <p>Mix one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing detergent with two cups of cool water.
                    Using a clean white cloth, sponge the stain with the detergent solution.
                    Blot until the liquid is absorbed. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the stain disappears.
                    Sponge with cold water and blot dry.
                    Or, using a clean white cloth,  sponge the stain with a dry-cleaning solvent.
                    Blot until the solvent is absorbed. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until the stain disappears.</p>
                <h2>RED WINE</h2>
                <p>Blot the spill with paper towels or a clean cloth. Combine 1 teaspoon carpet shampoo (or
                    dish soap, like Dawn) and 1 cup hydrogen peroxide in a small bowl. Soak a clean sponge in
                    the mixture, squeeze it halfway dry, then gently blot the stain. Continue until the stain lifts.
                    Sponge the stained area with warm water. Blot dry with a clean cloth or paper towels.</p>
